# Soulgun
A cross-platform "bullet hell" game where your gun can possess your enemies.  The player will dodge bullets from neverending barrage of robotic and humanoid enemies. If the players projectile kills a humanoid, the player will change to the humanoids location and inherit its shooting style.

## Build instructions macOS

Easiest way to get SDL2 and SDL2_image going on your mac is using Homebrew. 

	https://brew.sh/
	
After installing homebrew, just type:

	brew install SDL2
	brew install SDL2_image
	
This will add the needed SDL2 framework to compile Soulgun.

After that you can easily compile the game by typing "make" from the terminal in the game directory where the Makefile is.

## Build instructions Linux

If you have administrator privileges on your machine, follow these LazyFoo tutorials to install [SDL2](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/linux/index.php) and [SDL2_image](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/06_extension_libraries_and_loading_other_image_formats/linux/index.php)

If you do not have admin permissions or are unable to install it in traditional ways, do this using your command line.

	Go to the directory you wish to install SDL2, and remember the path name of that directory
	Enter the command: git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL.git
	Go into the SDL directory: cd SDL
	Open the Makefile file and change the prefix to the absolute path to get to your directory/local
	Back on the command line, create a directory called build, and enter it: mkdir build; cd build
	Run the configure script in the parent directory: ../configure
	Compile and install SDL: make; make install
	Do the same for SD2L_image
	Then in the Soulgun directory, compile Soulgun with this command: make lab


## Build instructions Windows

Windows is currently not supported and has many bugs. 

If you would still like to install Soulgun on Windows you can follow [LazyFoo's Windows installation guides](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/index.php), or [Giovanni Codes Games' VSCode installation guide](https://giovanni.codes/setup-sdl2-with-visual-studio-code-and-mingw64-on-windows/).

Be aware that the setup for SDL2 and SDL2_image can be very finicky.


## Overview of how entities and projectiles work
* Humanoids can be either humans or robots. A humans soul can be stolen by the player, giving the player the stats of the human. Human and robots stats include health, movement speed, a shooting cooldown, and bullet patterns. 
* The spawning of humanoids is managed by the display manager, which generates humanoids with random stats near the player. The spawn rate increases over time. Movement is also handled by the display manager. Robots move vertically and horizontally, while humans move diagonally.
* Entity bullet patterns are defined by two variables, the shoot style, and a function that defines the projectiles movement. The shoot style of an entity is what defines the number and orientation of bullets when they are fired. The projectile movement function defines how the bullet will move after it has been spawned. These two variables are randomized separately, creating a fair amount of unique combinations.

## Player Control
* Movement
	* Hold the Up/Down/Left/Right arrow key to move 
* Shooting
	* Hold space to shoot. Aiming is based on previous movement direction


## Development Roadmap at the Start of the Term
Development will happen in one week sprints, with each sprint introducing the features specified below.  Specific milestone deadlines may be shifted as needed.  After the last of these sprints we hope to have a coherent game whose mechanics and assets can be easily built upon.

### Week 1 - Prototype
- Basic Game Engine
	- Main Loop
		* Construct the main game loop to handle rending of graphics and handle user input
	- Onscreen Entities
		* Objects to represent the player, enemies, and their respective locations
	- Map with Partial Display
		* A map system to display only a portion of the map depending on player location

### Week 2
- Player Movement
	* Enable user to move around map with user input
- Enemy Spawning System
	* System for continuously spawning a limited number of enemies in proximity to the player entity
- Projectiles & Collision
	* Player and enemies shoot projectiles
	* Players and enemies disappear from map when projectiles collide with them

### Week 3
- Humanoid Enemy Type 
	* Enable an enemy to be “possessed” by the soulgun
- Soulgun Functionality
	* Alternate firing mode that causes player entity to switch with humanoid enemy
	* Soulgun projectile only collides with humanoid enemies

### Week 4 - Minimum Viable Product
- Enemy Movement AI
	* Enemies face and toward player and move around or away if player gets too close
	* Enemies position themselves in a relavtively even distribution
- Scoring
	* Points and/or timer

### Week 5
- Quality Assurance
	* Test for bugs
- Cosmetic Enhancements
	* Better sprite graphics 
	* Rudimentary Sound effects
	* Better map graphics
